## DnCNN: Denoising Convolutional Neural Network with Pneumonia Classification

This project implements a Denoising Convolutional Neural Network (DnCNN) that not only performs image denoising but also classifies chest X-ray images to detect the presence of pneumonia. The model is designed for dual tasks: enhancing image quality by removing noise from corrupted images and leveraging the cleaned images to classify whether a patient has pneumonia or not. 

### Features:
- Noise reduction for natural and medical images
- Pneumonia classification from chest X-rays
- Deep CNN architecture for effective learning
- Generalizes well across various noise levels
